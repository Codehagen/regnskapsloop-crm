# Task Page Improvements

Implementation of improvements to the tasks page to match the patterns used in the leads page for better UX.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research current task implementation
- [x] Research kanban-view.tsx toast and revalidation patterns  
- [x] Research skeleton loading patterns used in other components

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Test all functionality end-to-end

## Summary of Improvements

Successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to the tasks page, bringing it to feature parity with the leads page:

### âœ… Core Functionality
- **Toast Notifications**: Rich success/error messages with task details and status transitions
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with graceful error revert
- **Skeleton Loading**: Consistent loading states during data fetching
- **Suspense Integration**: Better perceived performance with instant page loads

### âœ… User Experience
- **Empty State Handling**: Informative messages when no tasks exist or search yields no results
- **Search Functionality**: Search across task titles, descriptions, business names, and assignee names
- **Dual View Support**: Both Kanban and Table views for different user preferences
- **Consistent Design**: All icons use tabler/icons-react for visual consistency

### âœ… Table Features
- **Comprehensive Columns**: Title, description, status, priority, business, assignees, due date, created date
- **Smart Sorting**: Sortable columns with appropriate Norwegian labels
- **Visual Indicators**: Status and priority badges, overdue highlighting, avatar displays
- **Responsive Design**: Proper truncation and responsive behavior

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
- **Server Actions**: Proper search with workspace and user filtering
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized data fetching and state management

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research current task implementation
- [x] Research kanban-view.tsx toast and revalidation patterns  
- [x] Research skeleton loading patterns used in other components
- [x] Update TasksClient to add toast notifications for status changes
- [x] Implement proper error handling with revert functionality
- [x] Create TasksSkeleton component for loading states
- [x] Update tasks page to use Suspense with skeleton
- [x] Add empty state handling for tasks (when no tasks exist)
- [x] Add search functionality for tasks (similar to leads)
- [x] Add task table view with proper columns and sorting
- [x] Update icons to use tabler/icons-react for consistency
- [x] Enhanced kanban cards with rich information display
- [x] Added priority indicators, assignee avatars, due dates, business associations
- [x] Implemented overdue task highlighting
- [x] Updated skeleton to match enhanced card structure

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement task filtering by assignee or business
- [ ] Add bulk task actions (mark multiple as complete, etc.)
- [ ] Add task detail view/modal
- [ ] Add task comments/activity tracking

## Implementation Plan

Based on research, we need to implement the following patterns from the leads page:

### 1. Toast Notifications
- Import `toast` from "sonner" in TasksClient
- Add success toast when task status changes successfully
- Add error toast when status change fails
- Include detailed information in toast (task name, old status â†’ new status)

### 2. Error Handling & Revert
- Store original tasks state before optimistic update
- Revert local state if API call fails
- Show appropriate error message to user

### 3. Skeleton Loading
- Create TasksSkeleton component similar to KanbanSkeleton
- Use Suspense wrapper in tasks page
- Show skeleton during initial load and transitions

### 4. Revalidation
- Already implemented in updateTaskStatus action
- Ensure proper revalidatePath calls for /tasks and related business pages

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Follow Leads Pattern**: Mirror the exact pattern used in LeadsClient for consistency
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update local state immediately, revert on error
3. **Rich Toast Messages**: Include task name and status transition details
4. **Skeleton Loading**: Use consistent skeleton patterns across the app
5. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

## Data Flow

```
User drags task â†’ Optimistic UI update â†’ API call â†’ Success toast | Error toast + revert
Page load â†’ Show skeleton â†’ Load data â†’ Hide skeleton â†’ Show content
```

## Technical Components Needed

1. **TasksSkeleton Component**
   - Similar structure to KanbanSkeleton
   - Support for task kanban columns (ikke_startet, pabegynt, ferdig)
   - Configurable number of task cards per column

2. **Enhanced TasksClient**
   - Toast import and usage
   - Error handling with state revert
   - Loading states management
   - Optimistic updates

3. **Suspense Integration**
   - Wrap TasksClient in Suspense
   - Use TasksSkeleton as fallback
   - Ensure server components are properly async
